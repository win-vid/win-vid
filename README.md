## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Winston and welcome. </br>
I am a creative, collaborative film-maker who does not shy away from challenging tasks. Currently I am studying International Media and Computer Science at the University of Applied Sciences Berlin (HTW). The major covers all core aspects of computer science and also delves into special subjects like computer-graphics, web-development, image manipulation as well as 3D-design (modelling and texturing in Maya) and game development. I am eager to grow my knowledge and enhance my skills. Follow me on my journey as I try to unite my two passions, programming and film-making.

Iâ€™m currently working on an indie game together with my fellow students called "Dolly's House".
